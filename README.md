This repository contains the **group project** for TEB1093: Statistics and Empirical Method. The project investigates whether different lifestyle patterns (sedentary, moderately active, highly active) lead to statistically significant differences in **daily step count** and **sleep quality** using R.

## 🏗 Project Overview

* Classify participants into **Sedentary (<5000 steps), Moderately Active (5000–9999 steps), and Active (≥10,000 steps)**  
* Perform **hypothesis testing**:

  - Paired t-test (small-sample)  
  - Independent two-sample t-test  
  - One-way ANOVA (with optional Tukey HSD post-hoc)  
* Generate plots (boxplots, histograms, Q-Q plots) and interpret results using R

**Dataset:** `health_fitness_dataset` (downloadable from Kaggle: [health_fitness_dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evan65549/health-and-fitness-dataset))  

> ❗ Dataset is not included due to size limitations
